# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! There are several ways to contribute, including the following.

- Adding or commenting on tasks in our project management system, On GitHub.
- Contributing to the design process.
- Suggesting new components and design tokens.
- Writing and submitting code.
- Reviewing code.
- Updating and expanding library documentation.


## Resources

- [**Atlas Figma**](): design with Atlas components in Figma.
- [**GitHub**](): code repo for Atlas.

## How to stay up-to-date

Consider following Atlas design, development, roadmaps, and releases in these places:

- [GitHub Projects](): used to track the
  work, and allows others the opportunity to subscribe to tasks, add comments, and claim tasks.
- [Discord OSM-NG]().
- [ADRs section](../using-atlas/adrs/overview): used to document technical decisions about the library.

## Task tracking

**I want to know the status of something**

Visit the [Atlas]() and
[GitHub Project]().

**I want to request a feature**

You are welcome to create new tasks with the #Atlas and #Design-System-Team tags. New tasks will
go into our "Needs Triage (Incoming Requests)" column and will be triaged regularly. Please remember
that Atlas is maintained by a nonprofitâ€”we won't be able to meet all feature requests, and it might
take time to get to your request.

To request a new component, please fill out the [new component issue template](https://github.com/Gustavo22Soaresh/Atlas/issues/new?template=-componentname---add--componentname--component-to-atlas.md).

**I want to contribute to a task**

Great! Create or claim a task as soon as you decide to work on it. This will help avoid overlapping,
duplicate, or conflicting work. If you're creating a task, add as much detail as you can about the
scope of the task: for example, what needs to be completed before the task can be considered "done"?
