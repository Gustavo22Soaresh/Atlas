# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! There are several ways to contribute, including the following.

- Adding or commenting on tasks in our project management system, Phabricator (links below).
- Contributing to the design process.
- Suggesting new components and design tokens.
- Writing and submitting code.
- Reviewing code.
- Updating and expanding library documentation.

Contributions to Codex are covered by the [Code of Conduct for Wikimedia technical spaces](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Code_of_Conduct).

## Resources

- [**Codex Figma**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1448742124788019850/codex): design with Codex components in Figma.
- [**MediaWiki**](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Codex): learn about using Codex within MediaWiki.
- [**Gerrit**](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/admin/repos/design/codex): visit the canonical Codex codebase.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/wikimedia/design-codex): visit a mirror of the Gerrit codebase on GitHub.

## How to stay up-to-date

Consider following Codex design, development, roadmaps, and releases in these places:

- [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-system-team/): used to track the
  work, and allows others the opportunity to subscribe to tasks, add comments, and claim tasks.
  [Learn more about the use of Phabricator at the Wikimedia Foundation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Project_management).
- [Team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_System_Team): used to share information about
  the Design System Team's mission, vision, work streams, objectives/key results (OKRs), and
  roadmap.
- Mailing lists: used to share release notes and summaries for major and minor releases:
  - Wikimedia tech news mailing list ([wikitech-l](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/wikitech-l.lists.wikimedia.org/))
  - Wikimedia design mailing list ([design.public](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/design.lists.wikimedia.org/))
- [ADRs section](../using-codex/adrs/overview): used to document technical decisions about the library.

## Task tracking

Tasks are tracked in Phabricator. We use two different Phabricator workboards:

- [Codex](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/codex/): used to indicate that a task is related to
  Codex. We do not track task status here.
- [Design-System-Team](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-system-team/): used to
  triage, sort, prioritize, and refine tasks that the Design System Team and contributors will
  work on. We track status of actively worked on tasks in
  [sprint milestones](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/subprojects/5858/).

> I want to know the status of something

Visit the [Codex](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/codex/) and
[Design-System-Team](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-system-team/) workboards in
Phabricator to check if a task exists for that work (for detailed Phabricator search tips, visit
[this page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Help?tableofcontents=0#Searching_for_items)).
If so, the task will be in the column that represents its current status. If not, you can
create a task (see below) or contact us (see the
[Design System Team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_System_Team) on mediawiki.org)

> I want to request a feature

You are welcome to create new tasks with the #Codex and #Design-System-Team tags. New tasks will
go into our "Needs Triage (Incoming Requests)" column and will be triaged regularly. Please remember
that Codex is maintained by a nonprofitâ€”we won't be able to meet all feature requests, and it might
take time to get to your request.

To request a new component, please fill out the [new component task template][new-component-phab-template].

> I want to follow parts of your work

[Create a Phabricator account](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Help#Creating_your_account)
and add yourself as a subscriber to a task to get notified when updates are made.

> I want to contribute to a task

Great! Create or claim a task as soon as you decide to work on it. This will help avoid overlapping,
duplicate, or conflicting work. If you're creating a task, add as much detail as you can about the
scope of the task: for example, what needs to be completed before the task can be considered "done"?
